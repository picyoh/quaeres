I am curious and appreciate new technologies, which has led me to discover and use languages ​​and tools other than those typically used in web development.\
For exemple, I became interested in computer vision and AI, and developed an OpenCV web application.\
I also learned about virtualization using Qubes OS.\
I am also interested in cybersecurity and continue to train in this field.
