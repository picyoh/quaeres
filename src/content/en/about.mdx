intuitive user experiences and robust web architectures.\

I transform complex business requirements into elegant, user-friendly applications that drive results.

### Stack

My expertise spans modern frontend frameworks like React or Astro, ensuring dynamic and engaging user interfaces. \
Every project is built with a focus on high-speed performance, accessibility, and modern SEO standards. \

### But also

I am curious and appreciate new technologies, which has led me to discover and use languages ​​and tools other than those typically used in web development.\
For exemple, I became interested in computer vision and AI, and developed an OpenCV web application.\
I also learned about virtualization using Qubes OS.\
I am also interested in cybersecurity and continue to train in this field.
